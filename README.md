# Rubic-s-cube-solver
This is an Arduino  code for solving the Rubic's cube with a 6-motors robot. The code is a Brute Force Algorithms representing Fridrish method for solving Rubic's cube.

The robot uses 6 stepper motors to move to the cube's faces. The code is too long ,i think it still needs some reviewing.
